performance, etc testing. His goal is to simplify your life by installing all the dependencies needed, let you just write your tests and run them without headache.\n\n## Provided features\n\n- Simple testing config through `.testsconfig` JSON file\n- Testing using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html)\n\t- Automatically pack and compile ES6 js tests to ES5 using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)\n- Performance tracking\n\t- coming soon\n\n## Install\n\n```npm install coffeekraken-testing-stack --save-dev```\n\n## Usage\n\nSet your test script in your ```package.json``` file like this\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"scripts\" : {\n\t\t\"test\" : \"coffeekraken-testing-stack\"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration pass by creating a ```.testsconfig``` file at thr root of your project, just like a ```.babelrc``` or any other tools out there\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"karma\" : {\n\t\t\"files\" : [\n\t\t\t\"tests/**/*.js\"\n\t\t],\n\t\t\"browsers\" : [\"PhantomJS\"],\n\t \t\"others karma config...\"\n\t},\n\t\"performance\" : {\n\t\t\"coming soon\"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nSee [karma available configurations](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/config/configuration-file.html)\n\nBy default, the karma package will use mocha as testing framework, but you can as well change that by overriding the configuration. Don't forget to install tha packages needed [here](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/karma-plugin)\n\n## Performance\n\nfeature coming soon\n","maintainers":[{"name":"coffeekraken","email":"hello@coffeekraken.io"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-05-30T14:38:23.775Z","created":"2017-05-30T14:05:09.048Z","0.0.1":"2017-05-30T14:05:09.048Z","0.0.2":"2017-05-30T14:38:23.775Z"},"keywords":["testing","js","mocha","karma","phantomjs","CI","webpack"],"author":{"name":"Coffeekraken","email":"hello@coffeekraken.io"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"592d83df-1c46\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 30 May 2017 14:38:23 GMT","_cached":true}
